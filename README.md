# GoldBadgeConsoleApp
Hello thank you for checking out my solution of projects called GoldBadgeConsoleApp. In this repository I get to show of some of the skills I've learned over the past few weeks within the gold badge semester of this course, hence the name.
The solution consists of nine assemblies, three projects for each challenge and the numbers in the naming conventions help seperate the individual projects.  
The first challenge we created a new menu for Komodo Insurance, Which i created to serve Latinx food.
The second challenge we created a new app for to handle insurance claims for the Komodo Claims department because they came across a bug in their software.
In the third challenge we helped Komodo Insurance fix their badging system by creating a new app that would display a badge ID and the list of doors it's accessible to, as well as allow you to edit, create, update, or delete a badge ID and the doors they're accessible to.
